## Site 1
- https://formandaffect.com/
- Through their twitter account.
- Looks modern/swiss inspo. Use of large type. Some retro colours. 
- Typical offscreen. Hamburger icon (attempt to differentiate it a bit)
- On load logo animation. Fixed header scrolls into view. Project card interactive animation (lets user know its clickable)
- Yeah, it's alright. Cool transitions and animations. Dig the whitespace.
- Graphik typeface, letter spacing/tracking is way too tight. Bold face is too heavy.
